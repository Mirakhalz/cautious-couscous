        <h2>A brief history</h2>
    </div>


    <p>The name Challenger was first given to the Dodge Coronet released in 1959. The car was a special edition called Dodge Silver Challenger, and it didn’t 
        exactly look like a typical muscle car. As a matter of fact, the era of muscle cars was just around the corner. Ford and Chrysler were coming up with the ideas 
        that would change the automotive world in just a couple of years. Check out car covers for your Chrysler 300c.</p>    
    
    <p>Ford is often credited as the company who made the Americansfall in love with muscle cars. They were pioneers, eager to combine excellent performance with 
        a very strong engine. Ford’s competitors had to release something which could rival their Mercury line. The demand for longer and more powerful cars was 
        growing each day. This prompted Dodge to start developing the first Challenger.</p>
